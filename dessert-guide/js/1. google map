Why this website:
I'm always asked by friends and family that come to visit SF and the Bay Area for spots to eat or places with MUST EAT desserts. I decided that rather than giving them a list of dessert spots, I can make a website that puts together my favorite ones with pictures, highlights and a map of where each of them are. I have a main page with a scrollable dessert guide and the map that corresponds with each of the different posts. I was able to make the anchors clickable through the info box. I initally tried to make the marker itself anchor through javascript with  a lot of help, but this was a solution that made it work. I did a lot of reverse engineering to get the markers to show on my map, by first working with a KML XML file which was not a good idea, and i instead created an array through hardcoding. I thought that the google maps api was interesting in the sense that it had its own set up and different commands that you had to sift through. I wish it was a little easier to work with and manipulate. 

things that i'm happy about:
anchors with the google map api and my html but had to hard code
flex box
used formspree for submissions

things i had trouble with:
figuring out the google map api in relation to html/js
getting the markers on the page
responsive design 

things i'd change/redo:
-using JSON to store my data
-less hard coding
-make it more interactive with JS like toggling between views and going through each post, i ran out of time to troubleshoot these
-making it responsive
