Why this website:
I'm always asked by friends and family that come to visit SF and the Bay Area for spots to eat or places with MUST EAT desserts. I decided that rather than giving them a list of dessert spots, I can make a website that puts together my favorite ones with pictures, highlights and a map of where each of them are. 

things that i'm happy about:
anchors with the google map api and my html but had to hard code
flex box

things i had trouble with:
figuring out the google map api in relation to html/js


things i'd change/redo:
-using JSON to store my data
-less hard coding
-finish my suggestions page
-make it more interactive with JS
-making it responsive
